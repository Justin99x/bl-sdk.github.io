Download and install [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK)  \n2. Download this mod by downloading the provided `.zip`  \n3. Extract the `.zip` archive into the `/Binaries/Win32/Mods` directory of your game.\n4. To enable the mod go start the game, go to `Mods` menu and press `Enter` on the `Constructor`  \n\n## Installing constructor addons/Non replacing mods\nSimply place the provided files/folders anywhere inside `/Binaries/Win32/Mods/Constructor`.  \nThe names of the files do not really matter, as most mods will add new objects, so they won't overwrite each other and\nshouldn't cause any compatibility issues.  \nIf you do care about load order, the files will be loaded in alphabetical order of their respective directory.\n\n## Using normal text mods alongside of the Constructor\nAs always, use BLCMM to configure your mods and decrease compatibility issues. \nAfter you are done in BLCMM make sure the files extension is `.blcm` and then place the file inside of the `Constructor` directory.  \nIt's basically the same as with constructor addons/Non replacing mods. Load order of the `.blcm` files is again, alphabetically.\nThe `.blcm` mods will then automatically be merged and enabled. \n\n## FAQ\n- Can I use gibbeds Save editor to acquire new objects? \n  - No, all your items will be stored in a `.json` file instead of the `.sav` file the game uses. You can open this `.json` with any text editor and simply give yourself any item you want, but you will need to know the parts object name.\n- Do I need all DLCs to use this mod?\n  - No, you only need the base game. But if you plan on using an addon that uses an DLC item as its base, then you will ofc need the DLC to use this new item.\n- Why does my game crash when I throw a grenade?\n  - This is related to multiple objects having the same name. So you either have a duplicate copy of an addon inside the Constructor directory or one of the addons you use has a bug/duplicate entry.\n- Does this work in coop?\n  - No.\n\n## Getting Addons\n- [Borderlands 2 Reloaded](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/272) \n adds 20+ new items to the base game, all of which can be farmed from specific sources. Planning on overhauling parts of the vanilla game later on, just wanting to get a beta out. -Created By: SteveKiller568  \n - [TPS Lasers in BL2](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/281)\n

Your Knuckle Dragger may drop the Norfleet, while your Hyperius drops The Cradle.\n\nIn addition to enemies, missions are also assigned new quest rewards, and made to be infinitely repeatable such that they can be farmed without resetting your playthrough. Your 'Shoot This Guy In The Face' mission may reward a purple Jakobs sniper each turn-in, while your 'Beard Makes The Man' mission gives Lucrative Opportunity relics.\n\nEach loot source had been hand-tuned to provide fair loot generosity. Longer missions give multiple instances of their quest reward, for example, and raid bosses drop multiple of their assigned drop guaranteed. If you don't get a drop from an enemy on the first try, they will drop a 'hint' item instead, giving you the option to decide whether to keep farming them.\n\nSeeds can be configured with different options regarding what types of content to include, such as the ability to disable rare enemies or enable raid bosses. They can also be shared with friends (for fun competitive scenarios), and can accomodate any DLCs being owned or unowned.\n\nLoot Randomizer works in co-op, with the best experience if all players run the mod (however this is not strictly necessary). The host player's seed will be the one which is in effect in co-op. Loot Randomizer is also compatible with most other mods, including major overhauls (e.g. UCP, BL2fix, Reborn). However, others which increase the number of items or enemies in the game will not fully integrate with it (e.g. Exodus).\n\nAll loot sources in Loot Randomizer:\nhttps://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/wiki/Locations\nAll items in Loot Randomizer:\nhttps://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/wiki/Items","tagline":"Create seeds to shuffle every item into new farm locations.","types":["Gameplay"],"supports":["BL2","TPS"],"issues":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/issues","source":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/tree/main","latest":"1.5","versions":{"1.5":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.5","1.2":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.2","1.1.5":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.1.5","1.1.1":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.1.1","1.1":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.1","1.0.7":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.0.7","1.0.6":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.0.6","1.0.5":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.0.5","1.0":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Loot-Randomizer/releases/tag/1.0"},"requirements":{},"license":[],"url":"/mods/LootRandomizer"},{"name":"Borderlands Commander","authors":["mopioid"],"description":"Provides hotkeys for number of useful functions in-game, including:\n*Saving and teleporting your position in the game.\n*Freezing time.\n*Modifying game speed.\n*Quitting without saving.\n*Toggling HUD elements.\n*Toggling Third Person camera.\nIn addition, you may configure your own arbitrary console commands for which to assign hotkeys.","tagline":"Provides hotkeys for number of useful functions in-game.","types":["Utility"],"supports":["BL2","TPS","AoDK"],"issues":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Commander/issues","source":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Commander/tree/master","latest":"2.5","versions":{"2.5":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Commander/releases/tag/2.5","2.1":"https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Commander/releases/tag/2.1"},"requirements":{"UserFeedback":">=1.5"},"license":[],"url":"/mods/BorderlandsCommander"},{"name":"Reign Of Giants","authors":["mopioid"],"description":"It's a concept we all know and love: Rare enemy variants, like Loot Midgets and Tubbies.

There's 2 types of things it randomizes. One is Firing Modes and the other is Projectiles.\n\nFiring modes are mostly used on weapons. Guns and vehicles use them.\n\nProjectiles are mostly used on grenades, however firing modes can have projectiles tied to them. \nYou'll find most weapons with different projectiles than thier firing modes, the projectile will come out of the weapon.\nProjectiles and Firing Modes will show on the item card.\n\nWeapons also have a 50/50 chance of projectiles being changed or even added to their firing mode.\n\nYou'll see on the item card what each has been randomized to. \n\nRequirements:\nHD Texture pack UNINSTALLED, your game will crash with the HD Pack on.\n\nSuggested:\nDXVK: https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4\nPlace d3d9.dll from the x32 folder in the same folder as bl2/tps exe\n\n4gb patch: https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/\nrun it, and select your bl2/tps exe\n\n\nPrepping the randomizer:\nI HIGHLY recommend you use the prep projectile randomizer option in the main menu.\nIt will load multiple levels until it's found the set amount of firing modes and projectiles.\n\nIt only takes 2-3 minutes (depending on your PC) and you'll be set for your entire session.\n\nIf you find your game crashing while trying to use the randomizer prep, id recommend lowering projectiles first, then firing modes.\n\nYou can also use the 4gb patch on the exe, which may help a bit. \n\n\nSaving Items:\nItems will get saved to a json file in 'saves' in the projectile randomizer. The save number will be the same as your character save number.\n\nYou can edit these saves by replacing the parts that you want.\nYoull just have to find the barrel, Firing mode, and/or projectile you want to replace in the json.","tagline":"Randomizes Projectiles on weapons and grenades.","types":["Gameplay"],"supports":["BL2","TPS"],"issues":"","source":"https://github.com/RedxYeti/Yeti-BL2-SDK-Mods","latest":"1.4","versions":{"1.4":"https://github.com/RedxYeti/Yeti-BL2-SDK-Mods/raw/refs/heads/main/ProjectileRandomizer/ProjectileRandomizer.zip"},"requirements":{},"license":["GNU GPLv3","https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0"],"url":"/mods/ProjectileRandomizer"},{"name":"New Weapon On Kill","authors":["RedxYeti"],"description":"After getting in game you'll want to enable the mod and choose your options.
