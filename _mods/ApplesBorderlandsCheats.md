Adds keybinds performing various cheaty things.

Features include (but are not limited to):
- Infinite Ammo
- God Mode
- One Shot Mode
- Ghost Mode
- Kill All
- Revive Self

Once enabled, visit your keybinds menu to configure binds for all these. You can also configure presets by pressing `P` when the mod is selected, which will allow you to bind multiple cheats to a single key.
