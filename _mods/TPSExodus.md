longDescription: "Features:\n- Kill it with fire! But only if it's fleshy. Rebalanced elemental damage that punishes you for using conflicting types, and applies new debuffs depending on the type you use - regardless of weakness.\n- Be what you set out to be. Vault Hunters are now better at what they're good at, and worse at what they're not. Zer0 for example is more agile, but less resilient, while Salvador has the opposite effects.\n- Guns that are greater than the sum of their parts. Weapon parts have been rebalanced across the board, sharpening up some of the underperforming pieces of the arsenal, and generally making them more specialized. Matching parts still kick ass!\n- Take the time to accessorize. Weapon accessories are now standardized across all weapon types.\n- New unique items. Discover new and exciting ways to mutilate your enemies.\n- New mini bosses. Got to find them all!\n- New rarity. Pearls! Yup, they are back. \n- Shields, but better. Shields now have improved stats based on their manufacturer, and boast greatly improved (and some new) special effects.\n- Introducing the Manly Shield line, as designed by Jakob's. Experience the feeling of bullets entering your flesh, without the searing pain. Jakob's Manly shields have no capacity, but boost your maximum health, and health regeneration.\n- â€¦ and much, much more.\nCheck out the full BL_TPS:Exodus changelog [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjfzrnl_MseW9tjlzaig0bYu2longbxEeibnIkCC23c)" # Description of what the mod can do
