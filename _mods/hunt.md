The official Borderlands 3 Hunt Tracker.

Automatically keeps track of which unique items you've collected.

Calculates a number of interesting stats about your run, and lets you display them in game.

Or, lets you export them to a text file for even more advanced customization in OBS.

Also contains a full encyclopedia of every unique drop in the game (or at least the Hunt-viable
ones), including the specific maps and enemies which drop them, as well as any other restrictions
the source may have.

And of course, there's a single massive list of everything, which you can use in case you're not
sure of the exact map, or if you just want to have some fun scrolling.
