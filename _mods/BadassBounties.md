Adds many randomly generated bounties to the game.
Each bounty will reward you with XP, Money and a random item upon completion.
The rarity of the reward items scale with your level.
To open the bounty board menu check your modded keybinds menu.

You can reroll your active bounties at any time for the cheap price of 2 Eridium per bounty that is not completed.
