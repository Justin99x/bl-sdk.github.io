Adds a few new console commands, and provides functionality for other mods to do the same. All these commands are fully compatible with blcmm files, you can just put them in your mod and have users merge it with other files and enable/disable various categories and it all just keeps working fine.

[See here for info on the builtin commands and how to write mods using them.](https://github.com/apple1417/willow2-sdk-mods/blob/master/.legacy/Writing-Mods.md)
