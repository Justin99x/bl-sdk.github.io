Adds various options that prevent you from equipping certain types of items/weapons.

Useful for allegiance or single rarity or weapon type runs.

Currently includes options for:
- Allegiance
  - Manufacturer
  - Override for allegiance relics
  - Override for usable items (health vials, sdus, etc)
  - Weapons Only
- Rarity
- Weapon/Item Type

Yes pearlescent rarity is missing, no I can't fix it, gearbox just set them to `RARITY_UNKNOWN`.
