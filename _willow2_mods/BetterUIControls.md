This mod will let you use your movement keys (in my case WASD) to control a bunch of menus. It also enables your Use key (in my case E) to select items in menus. The mod will automatically adjust to your keys.

Update 0.7:
Added the Stash Menus
Added a Quick Respec by hitting you reload key in the New U Menu
Added pressing your Status Menu (in my case Tab) to close the fast travel, vending machines, stash, and mission accept menus

Removed New U from planned menus because its not possible to control them via sdk

Current Working Menus:
Status Menus (Backpack, Missions, etc)
Fast Travel
Vending Machines
Quest/Rewards
Dialog Boxes, like the quit out screen
Vehicle station, but only left and right on the first screen
Stash Menus

Secondary Features:
You can hit your reload key on your weapons and gear to cycle if an item is favorited or trash
The main menu and pause menu now wrap, allowing you to quickly go to the top or bottom of the list
Alt Use to quick buy in vendors (including vendors like Earl)
Equipping gear from your backpack will no longer ask where you want to equip it
Quick Respec by hitting you reload key in the New U Menu
