After getting in game you'll want to enable the mod and choose your options. Also you can set up a hotkey to change weapons. 

Options include:
Weapon Type
Legit, cursed or very cursed weapons
How many kills between swaps
Showing the new weapon name on screen

Known Issues:
Gaige sometimes gets shotguns with 0 shot mags youll have to reroll manually.

Playing online:
If you have a gunzerker theyll want to host of thier action skill weapons will not swap properly.
If the gunzerker cannot host, they just need to press 2 or the dpad every after getting kills for the second gun to show up.

Non hosts pressing the hotkey may get their backpack overflown. just drop all the weapons from your backpack to fix it.
