When your action skill ends, a timer will start on your hud. 
The timer is fairly customizable, you can change its color, position, size and font. 
Note: The timer is more based on your action skill cooldown rate more than actual seconds. 
Thanks to ZetaDaemon for the farm counter, which made this possible.
