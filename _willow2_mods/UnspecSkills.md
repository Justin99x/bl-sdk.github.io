Allows you to right click on skills to remove points from them. Removing points does get restricted by having points further up in the tree meaning you cannot go unlock a later skill and then just remove points from early skills.

Modders can add custom conditions for removing points from skills, check the [README](https://github.com/ZetaDaemon/bl-sdk-mods/tree/main/UnspecSkills) for details on doing this
