Visualizes invisible blocking/killing collision volumes and allows hiding meshes with no collision.

Be aware that the game may hang for several seconds when enabling visualization in a map with many invisible volumes. Additionally, while kill volumes and blocking volumes can be toggled on independently, both of them will always be toggled off together.
