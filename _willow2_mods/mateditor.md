This SDK mod is a Tool for modders. It allows the user to easily change any `MaterialInstanceConstant` in realtime.
You can filter all Materials and Textures using a search field.
To change the colors you have the choice between using a slider, inputting your own values (by CNRTL+Leftclick) or using a color wheel.All changes can easily be exported to a `.blcm` file to use as a standalone mod or for a modpack.
