This mod gives you the ability to save your current skill build, then restore right back to it later.
When in game, hit your `Manage Skill Layouts` bind (Default: F3)
Then choose whether or not you want to save your current skill build, then type in your skill build's name!
From here, you can then restore back to that build for your current character class
