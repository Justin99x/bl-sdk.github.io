Changes subtle aspects of most game items, so they no
longer behave completely as expected.

# Alterations:

  - Projectiles may borrow each other's behaviors.  They
can make unexpected noises, follow odd paths, or even
home.
  - Firing modes can lase, split, ricochet, or change
speeds.
  - Parts have different effects on shield behavior.
A common Absorb shield with lucky parts may beat a Sham.
  - The same applies to classmods.  With good parts,
a high-level mod could potentially boost a skill more
than +6.
  - Lastly, relics now boost random attributes.  Really
want an artifact that improves corrosion damage and 
movement speed?  It might be out there...
*Note: relics are not supported on TPS.  Oz kits have
enough quirks already.*
# Usage:
From the main menu, under Mods, enable 'Effect
Randomizer (New Seed)'.  Bring up Options-&gt;Mods-&gt;Effect
Randomizer to enable the effects you want to change,
then load your character and start the session as usual.
The next time you launch the game, the Mods menu will
show a new enabled entry, 'Effect Randomizer (#)',
where the number is the newly-generated effect seed.
Remember that seed - if the game crashes, you'll need
to re-enable that entry.
