Allows the use of custom map files created by the MapEditor.
 To add/remove a custom map simply place/remove the .json map file into/from the  directory.
Each map file has its own Options/Mods entry that you can either enable or disable.
Because loading in and creating hundreds of new objects takes time, this mod will increase your Loading screen times.
If you absolutely can't live with ~4 additional seconds of Loading, check out the Options&gt;Mod Menu.
This mod comes with an optional ``Threaded Loading`` option. Enabling this option will remove any additional loading screen time,instead the custom map changes will load in over time.
