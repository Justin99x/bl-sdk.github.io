Memory program for Death Trap. You can press the keybind(default: 6) to save the data of your equipped shield. Death Trap will always copy the shield you saved if it is in your backpack.
The Memory is persistent.
To erase the memory, you could remove your shield and press the keybind again.
It works in multiplayer game when both the server player and the client player have enabled this mod.
